âœ… Preparation Strategy
JavaScript

Revise ES6+ features: let/const, destructuring, rest/spread, arrow functions, promises, async/await.
Practice event loop & async order questions.
Brush up array/object methods (map, filter, reduce, find, forEach).

TypeScript

Review core type system (interfaces, types, enums, generics, union/intersection, type narrowing).
Practice converting simple JS to TS.
Understand utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit, etc.).

ReactJS

Focus on hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useMemo/useCallback).
Understand virtual DOM and reconciliation basics.
Make sure you can write a small functional component fast.

Coding Practice

Use platforms like:
LeetCode (easy/medium JS)
HackerRank (JavaScript/React assessments)
TypeScript playground for fixing type errors.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Advice

Time is limited â†’ practice speed + accuracy.
Read carefully â†’ SHL often puts in trick options (subtle differences in code).
Stick to clean, readable solutions, not hacky one-liners.
For React, focus on functional components with hooks (class components are rarely tested now).
